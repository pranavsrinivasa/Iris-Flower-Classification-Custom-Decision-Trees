# Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning and Custom Decision Tree

This project focuses on Iris Flower Classification using traditional Machine Learning techniques, specifically a custom Decision Tree architecture. The accompanying Jupyter Notebook offers an in-depth exploration of the implementation.

## Project Overview

Iris Flower Classification is a classic problem in machine learning, and this project approaches it with a custom Decision Tree. Unlike neural networks, Decision Trees are interpretable models, making them valuable for grasping the fundamentals of machine learning.

## Key Features

- **Custom Decision Tree:** Implements a Decision Tree from scratch, enabling a deeper understanding of the decision-making process in classification tasks.

- **Machine Learning Basics:** Serves as a learning step to grasp the basics of machine learning, exploring concepts like feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

## Learning Focus

This project is designed to provide a foundational understanding of machine learning beyond neural networks. By working with a custom Decision Tree, you'll gain insights into the essential principles of model building, feature importance, and the decision logic behind classification tasks.
